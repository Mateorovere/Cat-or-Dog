# Cat-or-Dog
This is a clasification prediction excercise of a binary model (cat or dog)<br>
It also has an GUI which can run in python<br>
If you want to test it, you'll have to change the path of the folders <br>
I uploaded a small quantity of of pictures, but i recommend trying it with the whole dataset, which is in Kaggle
